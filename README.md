Leaflet.SimpleLocate
=

A Leaflet plugin displaying device location and orientation on the map, with orientation adjusted according to screen rotation. Tested on desktop and mobile versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari.

* Demo Page: [demo](https://mfhsieh.github.io/leaflet-simple-locate/) (activate: click the button, deactivate: double-click)
* Current Version: v1.0.4


# Usage

Simply include the [JS](dist/leaflet-simple-locate.min.js) and [CSS](examples/demo.css) in the head.

```html
<head>
    ...
    <script src="dist/leaflet-simple-locate.min.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="demo.css" />
    ...
</head>
```

And add the control to the map.

```js
new L.Control.SimpleLocate({
    position: "topleft",
    className: "button-locate",
    afterClick: (result) => {
        // Do something after the button is clicked.
    },
    afterMarkerAdd: () => {
        // Do something after the marker (displaying the device's location and orientation) is added.
    },
    afterDeviceMove: (event) => {
        // Do something after the device moves.
    }
}).addTo(map);
```

The CSS variable `--leaflet-simple-locate-orientation` changes based on the device's orientation and can be used to customize other HTML elements.
